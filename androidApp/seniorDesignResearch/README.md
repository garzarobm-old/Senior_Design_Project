# Directories of Relevance

## githubBluetooth
	- here you will find githubs that are most concentrated in what we want for our project, Miguel has looked throught BluetoothLeGatt (for Sparkfun board), but have not looked through other ones for information.

## seniorDesignResearch
	- here you will find some research that is relevant for our project. Here you can add to readme or research pile if you wish. Please update the folders readme according to what you add

## sandbox
	-here I put different kind android studip projects under what is called a sandbox
		- gatt is one that I developed a lot from one I found online to add transitions in activities without pulling any characteristic from sparkfun board
		- BluetoothLeGatt grabs select charactristics but doesn't have a real api, it is almost a direct copy from the github Repo BluetoothLeGatt.

# Hope
	- Senior Design has set up the sandbox repo so that one may integrate all components at one point in time, we can of course add to this if y'all would like, or y'all can make another folder. Just please document or at least tell others of the work you do! :)
