Definitions...
convolutional neural network for a KWS task: 
	-Regular network entails
		input layer: inputs speech, image, etc...
		output layer: delivers the label
		hidden layer: does the computation
	-CNN difference	
		-they are only connected to neurons next to it
		-they all have the same weight
	-how ^^ differences matter
		-



Deep learning:
	-examples: how google converts webpages to different languages
	-subsets: 	artificial intelligence
					|----> machine learning
						|----> deep learning
	-definition: has to do with how it copies human behavior
	-Differences:
		-picks out features by looking at object rather than just being feed certain features.
